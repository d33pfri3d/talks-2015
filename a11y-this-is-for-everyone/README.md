##This is for everyone


###Abstraction

You've nailed building cool looking websites with awesome 3D CSS transforms and no-jquery, you've mastered the art of SVGs and you know your SPAs from your MVCs. You're code is clean, well formatted, linted and you've taken the extra steps to ensure that you're HTTP requests are minimal by Gzipping and crushing your images. A good style-guide has ensured that there is a visual language in your design, your minimalist media-queries are taking care of multiple screen sizes and you've even included some unit testing. You're good to go...or are you. Have you even thought about everybody else who might want to access this?

A mouse? A Touch Screen? Maybe, like me, they use Keyboard navigation a-lot. What about screenreaders or another other assistive technology? Whilst focusing on Mobile-First and responsive design, maybe it's time we need to start really thinking about how people interact with the things that we make. If I can't navigate a form using a keyboard, it drives me nuts - imagine what that is like for someone who has no choice. Simple A11Y isn't hard to include whilst you're coding and with a little upfront planning and some testing (automated and manual) you can go a long way to make your next project a little bit more accessible to a fraction more of the connected population.

In this talk we'll look at some things we can all do to have some basic A11Y in our projects such as the use of ARIA tags (and what they do). We'll also look at some ways of testing, ways of improving and resources that we can all use to make the web for everyone.
